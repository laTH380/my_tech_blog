## Headings
Itatur? Quiatae cullecum rem ent aut odis in re eossequodi nonsequ idebis ne sapicia is sinveli squiatum, core et que aut hariosam ex eat.

## Images

### Local image, alt text as caption

The following image is located within the Hugo site. Because it has alt text but no title text, the caption is generated by the alt text.

![Jane Doe](../images/jane-doe.png)

### Image with alt text and no caption

Alt text is always recommended for SEO, accessibility and in cases when images don't load. However, you don't necessarily always want an image to have a caption. In that case, use a title with one space:

![A building](../images/building.png " ")

## Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a `footer` or `cite` element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.

#### Blockquote without attribution

> Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae.
> **Note** that you can use *Markdown syntax* within a blockquote.

#### Blockquote with attribution

> Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.<br>
> — <cite>Rob Pike[^1]</cite>

[^1]: The above quote is excerpted from Rob Pike's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c) during Gopherfest, November 18, 2015.

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but Hugo supports supports them out-of-the-box.

   Name | Age
--------|------
    Bob | 27
  Alice | 23

#### Inline Markdown within tables

| --------  | -------- | ------ |
